## Copilot features

### Inline Chat

The inline chat feature allows you to have a conversation with the cheerleader while you code. You can ask questions, get explanations, and receive suggestions in real-time. The cheerleader will respond inline, making it easy to follow along with your code.

### Code Review

The code review feature enables the cheerleader to analyze your code and provide feedback. It can identify potential issues, suggest improvements, and help you understand best practices. This feature is particularly useful for learning and improving your coding skills.

### Rubber Duck Debugging

The rubber duck debugging feature allows you to explain your code to the cheerleader as if it were a rubber duck. This technique can help you clarify your thoughts, identify bugs, and gain a deeper understanding of your code. The cheerleader will listen and provide feedback, making the process more interactive and engaging.

## Editor Support

### Encouragements

The cheerleader provides encouragements based on your coding activity. It can recognize when you're making progress, completing tasks, or overcoming challenges. The cheerleader will offer positive reinforcement to keep you motivated and focused. It also reads from the console output, build/test results, and LSP feedback to provide relevant encouragements.

### Music

The cheerleader can play music to enhance your coding experience. We play a random free lo-fi music.

### Explain Pasted Code

The explain pasted code feature allows you to paste code into the cheerleader, and it will provide an explanation of what the code does. This feature is helpful for understanding unfamiliar code snippets or learning new programming concepts.
